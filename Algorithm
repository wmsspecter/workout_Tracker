# # # Python Program built to use the website Nutritionix API to create workout tracker log.
# # An API for the website Sheety was also used to generate data for input into Google sheets.
# Program: Workout Tracker w/ APIs
# Developer: Michael Alvaredelacampa
# ALGORITHIM: Initialize User Information:
#
# Set constants for GENDER, WEIGHT_KG, HEIGHT_CM, and AGE.
# Store APP_ID and API_KEY as lists (though they should be strings in a corrected version).
# Define the exercise_endpoint URL for Nutritionix API.
# Define the sheet_endpoint URL for Sheety API.
# Get User Input:
#
# Prompt the user to input details about the exercises they performed (workout_text).
# Set Up Headers and Parameters:
#
# Create a headers dictionary containing:
# x-app-id with the application ID.
# x-app-key with the API key.
# Create a parameters dictionary containing:
# The query field with the user's workout input.
# The gender, weight_kg, height_cm, and age fields based on the constants defined earlier.
# Send a POST Request to Nutritionix API:
#
# Make a POST request to the exercise_endpoint with the parameters and headers.
# Parse the JSON response and store it in the result variable.
# Print the API Response:
#
# Print the JSON result to check the exercise details returned by the Nutritionix API.
# Set Up Date and Time:
#
# Get the current date and time using datetime.now().
# Format the current date as dd/mm/yyyy and the time as hh:mm:ss and store them in today_date and now_time variables, respectively.
# Iterate Over Exercises:
#
# Loop through each exercise in the result["exercises"] list:
# Create a sheet_inputs dictionary that:
# Includes the current date (today_date).
# Includes the current time (now_time).
# Converts the exercise name to title case and stores it.
# Stores the exercise duration (duration_min).
# Stores the calories burned (nf_calories).
# Send a POST Request to Sheety API:
#
# Make a POST request to the sheet_endpoint to log the workout data.
# Use basic authentication with the provided username ("malvarez") and password ("marine1989").
# (Commented out alternatives for using a bearer token, which is not currently implemented.)
# Print the Response from Sheety:
#
# Print the response text from the Sheety API to check if the workout was logged successfully.
